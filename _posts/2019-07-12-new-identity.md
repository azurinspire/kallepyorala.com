## New indentity

In the past years I've been using AzurInspire as my online name for my photography. It was always bit weird to be sort of hiding behind some other name, but there was some quite logical reasons I ended up doing it; I already had the domain because I once had small company named AzurInspire and I've always thought my last name is bit too difficult for people outside of Finland. But it is time to change that, I've updated the logo, the address and I'm updating my social media sites little by little for that also.

### New layout and new platform

My old website was running on Squarespace and even though I was quite happy for functionalities of that platform, the price was quite high for the amount of traffic there is in my site. So I did a fresh start for this also and end up choosing [https://jekyllrb.com](Jekyll) and [https://netlify](Netlify) for the job. Jekyll is open source and Netlify offers a free tier which is plenty enough for my needs so I have extra 25€ to put something else in the month. I end up purchasing this template though the get up and running fast, but I think I will do a new one from scratch and let other photographers to download it free for their needs.
